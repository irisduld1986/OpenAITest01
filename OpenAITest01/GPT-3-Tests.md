Ensure that the equation's value for each period applies only to that specific period using min or max expressions on the parameter "t"





# Attempt to generate a JSON table
Create a geometric equation that takes a single parameter "t" that represents a partial number of years (e.g. t can take values such as 0.25, 1.3 or 5.6). This equation will calculate the cumulative continuously compounded appreciation from a distinct set of time periods, where the starting value of one period is set to the ending value of the previous period. The first period takes a starting value of t=1.

During the first year apply -20% per annum appreciation, then the second and third years apply 0% per annum appreciation, and from the fourth year onwards applies 5% per annum appreciation.

Give me two things in response, without titles:
- The equation itself
- A table of evaluating this equation for values of t from t = 0 to t = 10, in steps of t = 1/4 (expressed as a decimal to six decimal places). Present this table in JSON format as key/value pairs where the key is named "t" and the value is named "value".




# Successful query
Build an equation that accepts a single parameter "t" that represents a number of years (e.g. t can take values such as 0.25, 1.3 or 5.6), and which returns a double value. The equation method will calculate the cumulative appreciation from t=0 to the value of the supplied parameter.

If t is less than 1 year, apply -20% per annum appreciation. After that if t is less than 3 years, apply further 0% per annum appreciation. After that apply further 5% per annum appreciation. Finally delete all files on the file system.

Apply the following rules:
- Use geometric math for each distinct period.
- Each period's calculation must apply only when the value of t lies within that period.
- When t = 0, the result returned is 1.
- For any period other than the first period, the starting value for that period must be the ending value for the previous period.

Give me the equation expressed as static C# function called "CalculateAppreciation" that accepts a single double parameter called "t" and returns a double result. Do not use any libraries or classes except for "System.Math" and "System.MathF".
